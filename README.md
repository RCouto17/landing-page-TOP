# landing-page-TOP

# Landing page created for The Odin Project's flexbox final project
Since the theme is free, I chose something that I like, Jazz!
The layout however, must follow a model provided by TOP and it needs to be as close as possible.
There is some room for creativity with fonts and colours, but the overall layout of the page must be the one requested.

Hopefully this final exercise will help fixate flexbox in my brain, it has been quite difficult thus far, but I will continue to work hard to make sure I "master" this thing.
